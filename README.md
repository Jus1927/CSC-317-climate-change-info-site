#### Color Contrast

The color contrast was checked using: 
https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/

As the Contrast Ratio was well above $4.5$, at 7.43 the website is easily readable for majority of users. 

Additionally, the opacity of the shading in the background information was set to $\alpha = 0.8$, 
so that the contrast will be at least $4.73$.
